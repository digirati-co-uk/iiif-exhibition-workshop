# Exploring the Special Collections examples

There are 10 items on display today from the University of Leeds Special Collections. We have time to view and interact with these, and come up with some ideas to help develop exhibition or storytelling
examples as part of the workshop.

The table below details the individual items, their IIIF Manifest URL and the link to the items within the Special Collections website (where you can find detailed catalogue information and additional context):
