## Aim of the workshop

In this hands-on online workshop we will help you start to get familiar with IIIF, providing you with the initial insights required when considering it for your collections. We will then guide you through the steps required to publish your own IIIF digital object (known as a Manifest) using the easy-to-use tools provided by Digirati for today's workshop.

By the end of the workshop we will have covered the basics of the IIIF Image API and the IIIF Presentation API, providing you with a foundation to explore further. You can continue to use your workshop sandbox until the end of June to experiment and try out further activities in your own time.

Note there are a number of great online resources to enable you to learn more about IIIF in your own time or as part of an expert-led training course. The IIIF Consortium’s online training is a great place to start - and if you want to try going further today with any area you can refer to their course syllabus here: https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/index.html.

## Modern browser, Internet access

A modern browser, with access to the Internet to allow you to use the online tools and content that we'll leverage during the workshop.

## Assets, IIIF Manifests and IIIF Collections

Access to assets to use during the workshop. Ideally, to start you'll have some images that you can upload to create IIIF enabled images.

:::note
If you have access to existing IIIF images, these can be used. However, for the step "Creating IIIF enabled images" you'll need to upload some images into your IIIF Cloud Services instance so you can complete that stage of the workshop.
:::

These can then be used as part of building your own IIIF Manifests.

If you’ve not got access to suitable assets or don’t yet know what you wish to build, we have gathered some examples to help inspire, see [Examples of IIIF to explore](/examples-of-iiif-to-explore)

## Tools

### IIIF Cloud Services

The Digirati [IIIF Cloud Services](https://iiif-cloud.digirati.com/) is an open scalable solution for hosting, managing and delivery of IIIF enabled resources. The service supports the efficient storage of images and other digital assets. It supports fast image delivery at multiple resolutions and provides interoperability and support for IIIF APIs. It allows the creation and management of IIIF content including Manifests and Collections where they can be published.

### Open-source viewers

There are multiple IIIF-compliant viewers. Most allow users to pan, zoom, rotate, and resize images. Others have added features, such as search, annotations, etc, and may be more tailored for certain types of content and practical uses, such as comparing multiple images side by side or viewing 3D objects or video.

During today's workshop, we will use a number of these tools including:

#### Mirador

[Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) is a configurable, extensible, and easy-to-integrate image viewer, which enables image annotation and comparison of images from repositories dispersed around the world. Mirador has been optimized to display resources from repositories that support the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) API's. Mirador provides several workspaces for comparing image-based resources, suitable for use in both cultural heritage and research settings.

#### Theseus

[Theseus Viewer](https://theseusviewer.org/) is a IIIF-compliant, reference viewer that allows users to view, navigate, and interact with digital collections of images, audio, and video, especially in the context of cultural heritage and research applications.​

Theseus is very user friendly, will allow you to share your content with others, and also has wide support for the almost all aspects of the features the IIIF specification provides.

#### Universal Viewer

Originally created by Digirati for the Wellcome Library and then extended to cover the British Library’s broad set of use cases as a single ‘Universal Viewer’.
[Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/) has established itself as a popular community-driven IIIF viewer used by leading cultural institutions across the world supporting image, audio, video, and pdf as IIIF viewing experiences.

The British Library is now leading further developments of this open source project with their own dedicated team. Recent community sprints involving team members from the British Library, National Libray of Wales, Villanova University and other participants have been running over the past 12 months to help enhance and further develop the tool.
