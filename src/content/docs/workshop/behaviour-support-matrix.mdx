This page describes the IIIF `behavior` values supported on Canvas resources within the Exhibition Viewer. Behaviors allow you to control how canvases are displayed across different viewer variations available in the Manifest Editor preview options. You can add custom behaviours at the bottom of the layout panel. The buttons above the panel simply change which behaviours (as detailed here) are applied.

## Viewer Variations

The Exhibition Viewer supports three main variations:

| Variation | Component | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Delft Exhibition** | `DelftExhibition` | Grid-based layout with scrollable content blocks. Supports a presentation mode dialog. |

| **Delft Slideshow** | `DelftSlideshow` | Carousel-based presentation with manual navigation controls. |
