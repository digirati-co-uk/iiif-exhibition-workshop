    <p className="text-justify">
      In this hands-on online workshop we will help you start to get familiar with IIIF, providing you with some initial insights on how this open standard and supporting community can enable you enhance your research, education and presentation use cases when working with digitised Medieval content. We will start with a brief overview of IIIF concepts from the perspective of some common use cases. We will then guide you through the steps required to view and share IIIF content, before then creating your own IIIF digital object (known as a Manifest) using tools set up by Digirati and available IIIF content to experiment with.
