# Next steps

Thank you to all participants who joined us for one of the three workshops over the two days at the International Medieval Congress. We hope you found them useful and that they have provided some insights and ideas on how to leverage IIIF in your work!

The Digirati team would particularly like to thank all of the team at the University of Leeds for their input, guidance and support in our preparation and delivery of the workshops themselves. We were very grateful for the input and insight, and in particular the work that went into allowing the range of interesting Medieval content from the Special Collections to be available for the workshop on day 2. It was a privilege to have the material available side by side with it's "digital version"!

And finally thank you to the IMC organising team for inviting us to participate.

This resource will continue to remain available for anyone who wants to continue or resume with the activities we started.

Feel free to drop us an email with any questions at contact@digirati.com

Please sign up for the [IIIF Slack](http://bit.ly/iiif-slack) where you can get help from the IIIF community using the IIIF Slack, particularly the beginners channel.
