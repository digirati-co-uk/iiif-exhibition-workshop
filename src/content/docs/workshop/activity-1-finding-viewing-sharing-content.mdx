As discussed during the introduction section, every digital object (manuscript, book, painting, map, diary etc.) that is published and available on the web will have a unique Manifest URL. The Manifest URL is the key to explore that object in IIIF tools. So finding, selecting and copying the URL(s) will allow you to start working with the images and metadata in those manifests.

We've provided a number of starting points to help you explore and find some interesting IIIF enabled digitised material today; but also included details to enable you to confidently explore and find more after the workshop.

## Example Collection for IIIF Online Workshop

For this online workshop, we can use a prepared example collection of digitised content, curated from a range of cultural heritage and research institutes.  We have created a IIIF Collection which contains this selection of digitised objects, and you can use this Collection to browse and inspect some of those IIIF Manifests.

:::note
IIIF Collections

A IIIF Collection is another route to finding IIIF Manifests. This is used by institutes and organisations to organise their IIIF content into an appropriate structure for exploration. Some (but not yet all) IIIF viewers allow you to easily navigate through those Collections and find interesting digital content via their Manifest URL.
:::


### Step 1: Browse the IIIF Collection in the Manifest Editor

- Copy the Collection URL above
- Open the [IIIF Manifest Editor](https://manifest-editor.digirati.services/) in your browser
- Click on the 'Browse for IIIF' option

- Select the Home icon, which will then present and open the collection 'IIIF Examples'.

![IIIF Browser home configured with IIIF Examples Collection](/iiif-example-collection-configured-in-iiif-browser.png)

- The Collection will be displayed, with a grid view and a list view to explore the Manifests contained within this IIIF Collection


- Scroll through the list and select a Manifest, clicking on it to view the content

- Click to "Open Manifest"
- This will open the selected Manifest in the Manifest Editor, allowing you to view the IIIF Manifest in detail

You can also find this list of content in the [Examples of IIIF to explore](/workshop/examples-of-iiif-to-explore/).

### Step 2: Getting familar with the IIIF Manifest structure

Now that you have opened an existing manifest, you can browse and view the structure of the Manifest and the Canvases that form part of the selected digital object.

:::note
Any edits or changes that you make to the selected manifest or manifests, will only result in updates to the copy of Manifest that you have opened. This does not impact the actual published manifest, and the changes will be visible only to you or to anyone with whom you share a link to your manifest.
:::

The Manifest summary information is presented in the left hand panel, with the detailed metadata information in the right hand panel, together with any canvases that are present in the manifest in the central grid view.

In the right hand panel, you will see any completed properties in the “Overview” tab. This makes is easy to make quick edits without going through all the available properties or searching through the tabs. The tabs are organized in the same way as the IIIF Presentation API documentation. You can click on a tab to see all the properties that are available.

Some resources have a lot of properties. You can click on the “more” tab to see other tabs that are not shown by default. You can also resize either of the two sizebars to make more room for the editor by dragging the divider between the sidebar and the main panel.

### Step 3: Editing the IIIF Manifest and previewing your changes

As part of the learning exercise, you can make a change or two to the IIIF Manifest you are editing and see how that change is rendered in one or more IIIF viewers. You can edit the Manifest metadata, which is typically what is presented in IIIF viewers, since this metadata describes the digital object.

You can update the Manifest Label and Summary for example:

- Click on the Manifest summary icon in the left hand menu
- In the right hand panel, click on the "Descriptive" tab
- Update the Label and Summary values with some of your own text

To view your changes, you can preview those changes in a number of viewers that are configured within the Manifest Editor, including Universal Viewer, Mirador, Theseus and others.

## Much more to explore

You can find a selection of IIIF content to explore in [Examples of IIIF to explore](/examples-of-iiif-to-explore). In the next section we will begin to create/curate your own IIIF Manifest which we will then use later for our exhibition building exercise.
